src/validation/run_diagnostics.py
----------------------------------
Runs all data quality diagnostic SQL queries against the SQLite database
and produces a human-readable markdown report at:
    reports/diagnostics_report.md

Purpose: Determine for each scorecard failure whether it is a
  DATA issue  → fix the source CSV / cleaning pipeline
  SCRIPT issue → fix validate_data.py / constants.py

Important note on ordering:
  raceId and driverId are assigned by Kaggle insert order, NOT
  chronologically. All temporal ordering in this script goes through
  races.year + races.round (never ORDER BY raceId / driverId).

Run from the project root:
  python src/validation/run_diagnostics.py

Requires:
  data/processed/f1_database.db  (produced by src/feature_engineering/build_features.py)
